"""Process-wide configuration: every env-derived constant in one Module.

Interface: import the names. All values freeze at import time (same as when
they lived in app.py), and `conftest.py` sets BILLING_ENABLED=0 before any
import, so the test suite sees the same values through this seam as before.

Nothing here may import app.py, state.py, routers, or cloud: this is the
bottom of the dependency stack (DEEPENING category 1, in-process).
